# C++ Exercises from LearnCpp.com

This repository contains my C++ exercises along with my personal notes and thoughts as I work through the tutorials on [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/).

Each exercise demonstrates concepts covered in the tutorials. I use this repo to practice, experiment, and solidify my understanding of C++.

## Usage

To compile an exercise, I typically use a command like this on Ubuntu:

    g++ exercise_name.cpp -o exercise_name

Then, run the executable with:

    ./exercise_name

Replace `exercise_name` with the actual filename of the exercise you want to compile and run.
